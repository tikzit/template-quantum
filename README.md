To use this template:

1. Get TikZiT (https://tikzit.github.io)
2. Download this whole folder as a ZIP file [here](https://github.com/tikzit/template-quantum/archive/master.zip) and unzip it somewhere.
3. Load the included `.tikzstyles` file by clicking the folder icon in the top-right corner of TikZiT.

...and off you go! Just write a paper like you normally would. For best results, put your `.tikz` files in the `figures` subdirectory and include them with the `\tikzfig{...}` macro.
